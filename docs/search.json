WilkeGitHub: clauswilke \nPurpose and contents of the class\nIn this class, students will learn how to visualize data sets and how to reason about and communicate with data visualizations. Students will also learn how to assess data quality and provenance, how to compile analyses and visualizations into reports, and how to make the reports reproducible. A substantial component of this class will be dedicated to learning how to program in R.\nWhat you will learn:\nData visualization\nR programming\nReproducibility\nData quality and relevance\nData ethics and provenance\nDimension reduction\nClustering\nPrerequisites\nStudents are expected to have basic knowledge of statistics. Prior experience with the programming language R is beneficial but not strictly required.\nTextbook\nThis class draws heavily from materials presented in the following book:\nClaus O. Wilke. Fundamentals of Data Visualization. O’Reilly Media, 2019.\nAdditionally, we will also make use of the following books:\nHadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, 3rd ed. Springer, to appear.\nKieran Healy. Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction. Princeton University Press, 2018.\nAll these books are freely available online and you do not need to purchase a physical copy of either book to succeed in this class.\nTopics covered\n\nClass\nTopic\nCoding concepts covered\n1.\nIntroduction, reproducible\nworkflows\nRStudio setup online, R Markdown\n2.\nAesthetic mappings\nggplot2 quickstart\n3.\nTelling a story\n\n4.\nVisualizing amounts\ngeom_col(), geom_point(),\nposition adjustments\n5.\nCoordinate systems and\naxes\ncoords and position scales\n6.\nVisualizing distributions\n1\nstats, geom_density(),\ngeom_histogram()\n7.\nVisualizing distributions\n2\nviolin plots, sina plots, ridgeline plots\n8.\nColor scales\ncolor and fill scales\n9.\nData wrangling 1\nmutate(), filter(), arrange()\n10.\nData wrangling 2\ngroup_by(), summarize(), count()\n11.\nVisualizing proportions\nbar charts, pie charts\n12.\nGetting to know your data\n1: Data provenance\n\n13.\nGetting to know your data\n2: Data quality and\nrelevance\nhandling missing data, is.na(), case_when()\n14.\nGetting things into the\nright order\nfct_reorder(), fct_lump()\n15.\nFigure design\nggplot themes\n16.\nColor spaces, color vision\ndeficiency\ncolorspace package\n17.\nFunctions and functional\nprogramming\nmap(), nest(), purrr package\n18.\nVisualizing trends\ngeom_smooth()\n19.\nWorking with models\nlm, cor.test, broom package\n20.\nVisualizing uncertainty\nfrequency framing, error bars, ggdist package\n21.\nDimension reduction 1\nPCA\n22.\nDimension reduction 2\nkernel PCA, t-SNE, UMAP\n23.\nClustering 1\nk-means clustering\n24.\nClustering 2\nhierarchical clustering\n25.\nData ethics\n\n26.\nVisualizing geospatial\ndata\ngeom_sf(), coord_sf()\n27.\nRedundant coding, text\nannotations\nggrepel package\n28.\nInteractive plots\nggiraph package\n29.\nOver-plotting\njittering, 2d histograms,\ncontour plots\n30.\nCompound figures\npatchwork package\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
