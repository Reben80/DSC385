## Purpose and contents of the class

In this class, students will learn how to visualize data sets and how to reason about and communicate with data visualizations. Students will also learn how to assess data quality and provenance, how to compile analyses and visualizations into reports, and how to make the reports reproducible. A substantial component of this class will be dedicated to learning how to program in R.

What you will learn:

- Data visualization
- R programming
- Reproducibility
- Data quality and relevance
- Data ethics and provenance
- Dimension reduction
- Clustering

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have basic knowledge of statistics. Prior experience with the programming language R is beneficial but not strictly required.

## Textbook

This class draws heavily from materials presented in the following book:

- Claus O. Wilke. [Fundamentals of Data Visualization.](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz) O'Reilly Media, 2019.

Additionally, we will also make use of the following books:

- Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen. [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, 3rd ed.](https://ggplot2-book.org/) Springer, to appear.

- Kieran Healy. [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction.](https://socviz.co/) Princeton University Press, 2018.

All these books are freely available online and you do not need to purchase a physical copy of either book to succeed in this class.
